# AdversarialTuringTest

This is the source code and pretrained model for our paper, [An Adversarially-Learned Turing Test for Dialog Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08231). We proposed an automated Turing Test to classify whether a dialog response is likely to be generated by machine or written by human.

## Play with our trained model

Please [**download**](https://xiagnlp2.blob.core.windows.net/dialogrpt/hvm2.pth) our trained model (assuming you save it in folder `restore`). Then you can play with it by

```
python src/main.py play -ps=restore/hvm2.pth
```

The follow is some example context (`cxt`), hypothesis responses (`hyp`), and predicted scores. 
```
cxt:    Why does anything exist?
hyp:    Well, some philosophers have dealt with it, but I have never left satisfied
0.124
hyp:    Man, as an Buddhist, that answer is, in fact, no. Inside out there is nothing. Edits up.
0.338
hyp:    Thou doth not know Jesus his brother, and thou shalt thank him over zeth thou thirstin.
0.050
hyp:    A question like this is beyond my capability to solve.
0.034
hyp:    Why does anything exist?
0.010
hyp:    I don't know.
0.001
```

## Train a new model

This can be done with
```
python src/main.py train
```
